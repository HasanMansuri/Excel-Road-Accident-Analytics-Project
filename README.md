## 📊 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard — Excel Project

## Project Overview
This Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is built entirely in Microsoft Excel to analyze accident patterns, casualty severity, risk factors, and environmental conditions. Interactive charts and slicers help convert raw records into meaningful insights for safety decisions, planning, and reporting.
## 📄 Report Summary

This report provides a consolidated analysis of road accident data to highlight key risk patterns and safety insights. Car and motorbike accidents contribute to the highest casualties, with rural areas showing more severe outcomes due to higher speeds and slower emergency response.

Visibility plays a major role—accidents in darkness often result in more serious or fatal injuries. Seasonal trends show noticeable spikes in specific months, while road surface conditions such as wet or icy roads increase incident likelihood.

Single carriageways show a higher share of casualties, indicating infrastructure-related risks. Weather factors like fog and rain further elevate accident severity.

Overall, this dashboard supports informed decision-making for transport departments, safety planners, and policy creators by clearly identifying where and why accidents occur, enabling targeted prevention strategies.

## Real-Life Meaning of This Project
Road accident analysis plays a vital role in public safety and infrastructure development. This dashboard reflects the type of analytical tools used by:
- Government transport departments for monitoring accident trends  
- Traffic safety experts to identify hotspots and high-risk behaviors  
- Insurance companies assessing casualty severity  
- Road engineering teams evaluating infrastructure and lighting needs  

The dashboard simulates a real industry-level analytical workflow to support data-driven decisions.

## Files Included
- **Road Accident Data.xlsx** – Cleaned dataset used for dashboard  
- **Screenshot.png / Dashboard.png** – Dashboard preview  
- **Supporting Sheets** – Calculation tables (if any)  
- **README.md** – Project documentation  

## Key Features of the Dashboard

### Casualty Breakdown
Breaks down fatal, serious, and slight casualties to understand the severity distribution of accidents.

### Vehicle-Type Analysis
Shows casualties involving cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks, and more, helping identify high-risk vehicle categories.

### Monthly Trend Comparison (2024 vs 2025)
Line chart comparing accident counts by month to reveal seasonal spikes and year-to-year changes.

### Road-Type Impact
Casualties categorized under different road types such as single and dual carriageways to assess infrastructure safety.

### Road Surface Conditions
Accidents distributed across dry, wet, and icy surfaces to understand the influence of weather.

### Area & Location Analysis
Casualty comparison between urban and rural regions to highlight geographic accident risks.

### Light Condition Effect
Distribution of accidents in daylight vs. darkness, useful for evaluating the need for improved visibility and lighting.

### Interactive Filters
Slicers for weather, area type, and date allow dynamic filtering and deeper insights tailored to user needs.

## Insights From the Dashboard
- Weather and road surface conditions significantly influence accident severity.  
- Motorbike and car accidents contribute heavily to total casualties.  
- Rural regions experience higher casualty severity due to speed and delayed response times.  
- Darkness increases serious accident rates, highlighting visibility challenges.  
- Monthly trends show seasonal variations that can guide preventive measures.  

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Slicers  
- Line, bar, and doughnut charts  
- Data cleaning & formatting  
- No coding or external tools involved  

## How to Use
1. Download and open **Road Accident Data.xlsx**  
2. Navigate to the **Dashboard** sheet  
3. Use slicers to filter by weather, area type, or date  
4. Explore individual charts to understand trends and patterns  

## Conclusion
This Road Accident Analysis Dashboard turns raw accident data into a clear, interactive, and professional report. It showcases strong skills in Excel-based data visualization, storytelling, and analytical thinking, making it suitable for real-world transportation safety and decision-making applications.
