## Real-Life Meaning of This Project
Road accident analysis plays a vital role in public safety and infrastructure development. This dashboard reflects the type of analytical tools used by:
- Government transport departments for monitoring accident trends  
- Traffic safety experts to identify hotspots and high-risk behaviors  
- Insurance companies assessing casualty severity  
- Road engineering teams evaluating infrastructure and lighting needs  

The dashboard simulates a real industry-level analytical workflow to support data-driven decisions.

## Files Included
- **Road Accident Data.xlsx** – Cleaned dataset used for dashboard  
- **Screenshot.png / Dashboard.png** – Dashboard preview  
- **Supporting Sheets** – Calculation tables (if any)  
- **README.md** – Project documentation  

## Key Features of the Dashboard

### Casualty Breakdown
Breaks down fatal, serious, and slight casualties to understand the severity distribution of accidents.

### Vehicle-Type Analysis
Shows casualties involving cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks, and more, helping identify high-risk vehicle categories.

### Monthly Trend Comparison (2024 vs 2025)
Line chart comparing accident counts by month to reveal seasonal spikes and year-to-year changes.

### Road-Type Impact
Casualties categorized under different road types such as single and dual carriageways to assess infrastructure safety.

### Road Surface Conditions
Accidents distributed across dry, wet, and icy surfaces to understand the influence of weather.

### Area & Location Analysis
Casualty comparison between urban and rural regions to highlight geographic accident risks.

### Light Condition Effect
Distribution of accidents in daylight vs. darkness, useful for evaluating the need for improved visibility and lighting.

### Interactive Filters
Slicers for weather, area type, and date allow dynamic filtering and deeper insights tailored to user needs.

## Insights From the Dashboard
- Weather and road surface conditions significantly influence accident severity.  
- Motorbike and car accidents contribute heavily to total casualties.  
- Rural regions experience higher casualty severity due to speed and delayed response times.  
- Darkness increases serious accident rates, highlighting visibility challenges.  
- Monthly trends show seasonal variations that can guide preventive measures.  

## Tools & Techniques Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- Pivot Tables  
- Slicers  
- Line, bar, and doughnut charts  
- Data cleaning & formatting  
- No coding or external tools involved  

## How to Use
1. Download and open **Road Accident Data.xlsx**  
2. Navigate to the **Dashboard** sheet  
3. Use slicers to filter by weather, area type, or date  
4. Explore individual charts to understand trends and patterns  

## Conclusion
This Road Accident Analysis Dashboard turns raw accident data into a clear, interactive, and professional report. It showcases strong skills in Excel-based data visualization, storytelling, and analytical thinking, making it suitable for real-world transportation safety and decision-making applications.
